To complie the files use the command： javac *.java

To execute use the command： java Main (-arg0 -arg1 -arg2 -arg3). 
arg0 is the input file. The default value is "input.txt" which is our sample program.
arg1 is the name of the file saving the output of front end. The default value is "frontEnd_output.txt"
arg2 is the name of the file saving the output of DPLL. The default value is "DPLL_output.txt"
arg3 is the name of the file saving the output of back end. The default value is "backEnd_output.txt"

the command should be like: java Main, which will use the sample program to generate three other files: frontEnd_output.txt, DPLL_output.txt,backEnd_output.txt

the complete command shoud be like: java Main "inputfile" "file1" "file2" "file3", which will use "inputfile" to generate front end output file "file1", DPLL output file "input2" and back end output file "input3".
